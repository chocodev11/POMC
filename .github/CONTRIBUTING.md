# Contributing to Ferrite

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Ferrite!

## Getting Started

1. Fork the repository
2. Clone your fork and set up the development environment:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/ferrite.git
   cd ferrite
   rustup override set nightly
   ```
3. Extract vanilla 1.21.11 assets into `reference/assets/`:
   ```bash
   unzip ~/.minecraft/versions/1.21.11/1.21.11.jar -d reference/assets/
   ```
4. Build and run:
   ```bash
   cargo build
   cargo run -- --server localhost:25565 --username Steve
   ```

## Development Guidelines

- **Rust nightly** is required (due to `simdnbt` dependency)
- Run `cargo clippy` before submitting a PR
- Run `cargo fmt` to format your code
- No `unwrap()` outside of tests  - use `thiserror` for error types
- Comments explain **why**, not **what**
- Keep changes focused  - one feature or fix per PR
